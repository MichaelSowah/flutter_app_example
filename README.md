Flutter app examples

# Setup

The final code is generated from the current app template to avoid saving ten times the same things

```bash
cd support
pub get
```

You can generate each project one by one 

```bash
dart tool/demoidb_project_generate.dart
dart tool/notepad_project_generate.dart
```

or all at once:
```bash
dart tool/projects_generate.dart
```

# Run

Enter the app directory you want to run and use flutter tools

```bash
cd demoidb
flutter run
```
